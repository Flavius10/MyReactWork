Project: University Grading System Simulation
I created a small project to simulate the grading system at Babe»ô-Bolyai University, where users (students and professors) can input and view grades. The project was built using React for the front-end, which allowed me to create a dynamic and interactive interface with reusable components.

I used Material UI (MUI) to style the application, taking advantage of its ready-made components like buttons, text fields, and grids to build a clean and responsive design. This saved time while ensuring a professional look and feel for the app.

The application relies heavily on JavaScript for the logic behind grade calculation, user input handling, and real-time updates, making it a great opportunity to practice both my React skills and my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

In summary, this project helped me improve my React development skills, work with modern design frameworks like MUI, and enhance my proficiency in JavaScript for building full-stack web applications.
